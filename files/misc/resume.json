Both software were used in the search engine's indexing chain to index millions of web pages per day.\nThe computing framework allowed to build complex and dynamic pipelines to distribute and perform various kind of computation tasks. A module system was created to quickly develop and deploy new components as well as their resources (ML models, ...). It was possible to setup different priority policies to handle jobs during their processing.",
